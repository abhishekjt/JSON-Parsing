It also included the '''string''' type for easier text manipulation.\n\nSMALL was used extensively from about 1980 to 1985 at [[Auckland University]] as a programming teaching aid, and for some internal projects.  Originally written to run on a [[Burroughs Corporation]] B6700 [[Main frame]] in [[Fortran]] IV, subsequently rewritten in SMALL and ported to a DEC [[PDP-10]] Architecture (on the [[Operating System]] [[TOPS-10]]) and IBM S360 Architecture (on the Operating System VM/[[Conversational Monitor System|CMS]]).\n\nAbout 1985, SMALL had some [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] features added to handle structures (that were missing from the early language), and to formalise file manipulation operations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[ALGOL]]\n*[[Lua (programming language)]]\n*[[Squirrel (programming language)]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.caida.org/home/seniorstaff/nevil.xml Nevil Brownlee]\n\n[[Category:Algol programming language family]]\n[[Category:Systems programming languages]]\n[[Category:Procedural programming languages]]\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in the 1980s]]"}]}}}}
